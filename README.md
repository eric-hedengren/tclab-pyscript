### TCLab PyScript
This repository is an attempt to rewrite the [TCLab](https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab) python package into a functional package for the web. This will increase user friendliness when new learners are starting to code for the first time, using their [Temperature Control Labs](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl).

#### Web Demo
Before fully integrating the TCLab package into the web, a simple web demo has been created to show its future potential, and also give new users an easy way to show that their TCLab actually works.
