### TCLab PyScript
This repository is an attempt to rewrite the [TCLab](https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab) python package into a functional package for the web. This will increase user friendliness when new learners are starting to code for the first time, using their [Temperature Control Labs](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl).

## Read Branch
The purpose of the read branch is to demonstrate functionality when it comes to reading values from the TCLab.
